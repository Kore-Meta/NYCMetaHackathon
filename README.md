# Learn Japanese Alphabet in MR
## Produced by Kore-Meta team at Meta Hackathon in NYC

This is a language learning app built for oculus quest 3 during the Meta Presence Platform Hackathon in NYC in April 2024.
Our app aims to provide an immersive experience in mixed reality that makes learning Japanese hiragana alphabet fun and interactive.
We use the **Meta interaction SDK** to let users build a conveyor belt sushi resturant, interact with hiragana letters, and have fun making sushis using hiragana letters.
We also use the **Meta voice SDK** to let user practice speaking Japanese and check if their pronouciation is correct.
We use the **Meta audio SDK** to allow for fancy sound effects.

To successfully build, please download the Japanese font asset (`NotoSansJP-Regular SDF.asset`) from https://github.com/nilpkthmsk/Unity_TMP_Japanese and place it under `Assets/TextMesh Pro/Resources/Fonts & Materials/`.  It is a very large file and our developer Xiaohan unfortunately ran out of git lfs quota from previous projects.

Make sure mic permission is allowed for our app in order for the Meta voice SDK to work properly.
